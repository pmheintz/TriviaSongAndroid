# TriviaSong android app

This android app is a port of my **TriviaSong** app for iOS available [here:]
(https://github.com/pmheintz/TriviaSong "TriviaSong iOS repo"). The app simply
launches and starts playing the song from _Jeopardy_. The song will repeat
indefinitely while the app is running. The app contains a button to pause/play
the song and another button to restart the song from the
beginning. Unlike the iOS app, this app does _not_ contain a slider to scan
playback time.

## Installation

Clone, fork, or download the project. Build the app in android studio or use
compiler of your choice. Run apk on an android emulator or your device.
